    <p>Fuller hypothesized that ancient seafaring civilizations had the capability to circumnavigate
        the globe. Fuller hypothesized that the Phoenicians, after leaving the Mediterranean, would have
        sailed south, rounding the African continent and crossing the Indian Ocean. They would then turn
        northward with the Japan Current and prevailing winds to transit China, Japan, and the Aleutian
        Islands to Alaska. From there, they could travel southward along the west coasts of both North and
        South America (following what is today called the “kelp highway”), then around the Horn using the
        “Roaring 40s” winds into the South Atlantic, and then the northward current would carry them
        along South America's east coast. The Atlantic Gulf Stream would carry them past Cape Hatteras,
        Nova Scotia, south of Greenland, Iceland, and Spitzbergen, eventually returning to the familiar lands of Scandinavia and the British Isles before reaching the Mediterranean. A comparison of this 
        description with a NASA video on ocean currents reveals that Fuller's depiction is generally
        accurate.</p>

    <p>Early seafarers likely navigated close to the coastline, much like a novice swimmer would
        stick close to the pool edge. As their confidence and navigational skills grew, they would begin to
        make increasingly lengthy "shore-hugging leaps" and even traverse open ocean.
        The world maps attributed to ancient scholars such as Hecataeus, Herodotus, and
        Eratosthenes were reconstructed much later, by Eurocentric illustrators, based on surviving texts.
        (See image of Eratosthenes’ map.) Fuller thought the ancient seafarers knew the world was round,
        (after all, ships begin to dip below the horizon as they leave port). Fuller thought these maps 
        depicted the Americas, although to our modern eyes these maps look highly distorted. Following
Fuller, on the De Virga World Map (1411-1415), I have added the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of
Mexico and South America to the map. (See image.) </p>

    <p>Even though it may be hard for us to recognize these reconstructions as world maps,
        envision an ancient vessel tracing the shoreline, marking down rivers, bays, and inlets as they
        proceeded. Left and right turns on the journey would correspond to the same on the map.
        Periodically, they would land to forage, hunt, or trade with local populations. After a long enough
        journey, they would end up back where they started, demonstrating a single continuous coastline
        encircling the ocean.
        To illustrate this, I created my own map showing the continents as one island surrounded by
        one ocean. (See image). Remember, although all maps have inaccuracies—they can still be useful.
        This one represents land in relation to sea, allowing one to navigate along the coast with a 
         reasonable sense of location. Despite distortions inside the land masses, it provides some utility for
        a sailor</p>
